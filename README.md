**FrogBot** is a collaborative effort among a few of us to create the best bot possible. Please note that the bot is still in a very rough state, and things are constantly breaking.

## Branches
- **üî• Beta:** This is the most updated branch and is constantly being updated and may break.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Dev:** A go-to point for PRs and other contributions, it's the more stable of the newer branches but not immune to breaking.
- **üï∞Ô∏è Old:** This is the first revision of the bot; there are a few broken things with it, and we wouldn't recommend using it.

*Note: Dev is considered the starting point for most people, as it's primarily for PRs, and we aim to keep it stable.*

## üöÄ Current Features
- Automatic role assignment based on points
- Points assignment and removal
- Points tracking
- Add points via reactions
- Respond to different messages
- Updating via commands
- AI LLM integration via Google Gemini-pro(-vision) with OpenAI Chat-GPT 3.5 Turbo as a fallback
- Image recognition via Gemini-pro-vision
- Reply context chain for the LLM; you can simply reply to the bot's message to continue the conversation
- Very basic and rough web search
